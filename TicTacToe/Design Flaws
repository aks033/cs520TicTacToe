The original implementation of the code had the following flaws:

1) Open - Closed principle:
    Issue: The original code was one single piece of code in the constructor and does not provide easy extension of the
    code. Also, the class is public and can be accessed by anyone.

    Fix:

2) Code Duplication:
    Issue: The logic of the game has been repeated 9 times for each button separately which makes the code redundant
    and increases the number of lines in the code unnecessarily.

    Fix: Created separate methods(diagonalCheck(), columnRowCheck() etc) to perform the logic.

3)  Modularity of the code:
    Issue: All the code has been implemented in the constructor and in such a case there isn't much flexibility
    for the developers to when working in a collaborative environment.

    Fix: Separated all the functionality into 3 classes i.e. Model, View and Controller and further separated the code
    into methods(readme.md).

4) Information Hiding:
    Issue: The variables and the constructor can accessed by anyone as their access modifiers are public. This makes
    the code accessible to everyone.

    Fixed: Fixed this issue by making appropriate changes to the access modifier of each variable and by keeping
    just the methods public.
