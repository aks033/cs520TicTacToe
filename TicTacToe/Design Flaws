The original implementation of the code had the following flaws:

1) Open - Closed principle:
    Issue: The original program is one single piece of code in the constructor and does not provide easy extension
    of the code. Also, the methods and member variables of the class are public and can be accessed by anyone.

    Fix: In case a class would want to perform additional functions then that can be materialized by implementing
    the interface.////////

2) Code Duplication:
    Issue: The logic of the game has been repeated 9 times for each button and for each player separately which makes
    the code redundant and increases the number of lines and conditional checks in the code unnecessarily .

    Fix: Created separate methods(diagonalCheck(), columnRowCheck() etc) to perform the logic.

3)  Modularity of the code:
    Issue: All the code has been implemented in the constructor and in such a case there isn't much flexibility
    for the developers to when working in a collaborative environment.

    Fix: Separated all the functionality into 3 classes i.e. Model, View and Controller and further separated the code
    into methods(readme.md).

4) Information Hiding:
    Issue: The variables and the constructor can accessed by anyone as their access modifiers are public. This makes
    the code accessible to everyone.

    Fixed: Fixed this issue by making appropriate changes to the access modifier of each variable and by keeping
    just the methods public.
